/**
  * Lazily FUSE-mounts model versions into the computing unit's local file system.
  *
  * The mount is NOT performed in this (user-accessible, unprivileged) pod. Instead the
  * pod asks the per-node `texera-mounter` (a trusted, privileged DaemonSet) to run
  * GeeseFS on its behalf; the resulting read-only mount is exposed back into this pod
  * through Kubernetes mount propagation, under a host directory scoped to this CU id.
  * A model version is addressed by a locator "<repositoryName>:<commitHash>"; since a
  * commit is immutable, a mount is created at most once per (repository, commit) for the
  * lifetime of the pod and reused by every subsequent worker/execution.
  *
  * The mount is authorized with the pod's per-user JWT, not with global LakeFS
  * credentials: the JWT is handed to the mounter, which passes it to GeeseFS as the S3
  * access key so it reaches file-service's JWT-authenticated S3 proxy exactly as a direct
  * mount would. Neither this pod nor the mounter holds any global LakeFS credential.
