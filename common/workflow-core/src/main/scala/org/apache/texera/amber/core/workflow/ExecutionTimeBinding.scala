/**
  * Setup a physical operator deliberately leaves until its execution starts.
  *
  * Everything here could in principle be computed while compiling — it is derived from
  * properties the user already set. It is left until later for two reasons. Compilation
  * runs again on every edit to a workflow, so anything expensive there is paid hundreds
  * of times for a workflow that may never be run; and some of the answers belong to the
  * computing unit that will run the operator, not to whoever compiled it.
  *
  * The Python UDF's `models` parameters are both: resolving one costs a database round
  * trip, and what it resolves to is a directory inside a particular computing unit.
  *
  * Implementations must be idempotent and should memoize — the engine may ask more than
  * once per execution, and a region that re-executes asks again.
