/**
 * An open workflow being edited.
 *
 * Edits accumulate in memory and are written back by `workflow_save` in one
 * `persist` call. `openedLastModifiedTime` is the optimistic-concurrency token:
 * the workspace UI edits through a Yjs document and persists from the browser,
 * so if that timestamp moved while the session was open, someone else (or the
 * user's own open tab) has written since — and a blind save would discard their
 * work.
 *
 * When `live` is present the session is also joined to the workflow's
 * shared-editing room, and every mutation is mirrored there so the user watches
 * it happen. The in-memory `state` stays authoritative for this client either
 * way, so the editing tools behave identically with or without a room.
