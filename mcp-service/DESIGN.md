# Texera MCP Service — Design

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets any
MCP-capable chatbot (Claude Desktop / Claude Code, ChatGPT Desktop, Cursor, …)
drive a **user's own account** on **any** Texera deployment — `texera.dknet-ai.org`,
`hub.texera.io`, a local `bin/local-dev.sh` stack — given only a base URL and a token.

```

```

## 1. What the platform already gives us

### 1.1 One origin, many services

Every deployment fronts all services behind a single Gateway hostname. From
[`bin/k8s/templates/base/gateway/gateway-routes.yaml`](../bin/k8s/templates/base/gateway/gateway-routes.yaml):

| Path prefix | Backing service | Used by the MCP for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/dataset`, `/api/access/dataset` | file-service :9092 | dataset CRUD, files, versions, sharing |
| `/api/computing-unit`, `/api/access/computing-unit` | computing-unit-manager :8888 | CU lifecycle |
| `/api/compile` | workflow-compiling-service :9090 | pre-run validation, schema propagation |
| `/api/config` | config-service :9094 | capability discovery |
| `/api/models`, `/api/chat` | access-control-service :9096 | (not used) |
| `/api` (catch-all), `/` | webserver :8080 | auth, workflows, versions, metadata, executions |
| `/api/executions/…/stats`, `/wsapi`, `/api/pve` | dynamic (per-CU) backend | (not used in v1) |

**Consequence: the MCP needs exactly one config value for the endpoint — the deployment
base URL.** Everything else is a path under it. This is why "user provides the link of
the deployment" works cleanly.

### 1.2 Authentication

[`common/auth/…/JwtAuthFilter.scala`](../common/auth/src/main/scala/org/apache/texera/auth/JwtAuthFilter.scala)
protects every service identically:

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` → HS256, shared secret (`auth.jwt.256-bit-secret`).
- Claims: `sub` (username), `userId`, `email`, `role`, `exp`.
- Default TTL `auth.jwt.expiration-in-minutes = 10080` (**7 days**), overridable per deployment.
- Tokens are minted by `POST /api/auth/login {username,password}` or the Google flow.
- **No refresh tokens, no API keys, no OAuth authorization server.**
- Failure semantics are precise and machine-readable — RFC 6750:
  - missing header → `401` + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="texera"`
  - bad/expired token → `401` + `error="invalid_token"`

> **Verified against a live deployment, with a caveat.** `texera.dknet-ai.org` answers
> `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="realm"` from its webserver — the older challenge, without the
> `error` parameter — while its file-service does emit `error="invalid_token"`. Deployments run
> mixed service versions, so the MCP must not rely on that header alone to diagnose an expired
> token; it also checks the token's own `exp`, which it can read locally.

**Chosen auth model (v1): pre-issued JWT.** The user pastes a token into MCP config:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "texera": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@texera/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TEXERA_BASE_URL": "https://texera.dknet-ai.org",
        "TEXERA_TOKEN": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Nothing is stored server-side; the MCP is a stateless proxy holding one bearer token in
memory for the life of the process. To make the 7-day expiry non-mysterious the server:

- decodes `exp` at startup and **fails fast** with an actionable message if already expired;
- warns on every tool result when `exp` is under 24 h away;
- maps any `401 invalid_token` to a single clear error: *"Your Texera token has expired.
  Get a fresh one: log in at `<base>`, then in DevTools run
  `localStorage.getItem("access_token")`, and update `TEXERA_TOKEN`."*

Deferred (documented, not built): personal access tokens (`user_api_token` table +
`/api/auth/tokens` + `JwtAuthFilter` opaque-token branch) would remove the expiry cliff and
give revocability and scoping. That is a backend PR to `apache/texera`, tracked separately.

Remote (HTTP) transport, when added, takes the token from the MCP request's own
`Authorization` header and forwards it — per-request auth context, no shared state,
no credentials at rest.

### 1.3 Workflow representation

Two different shapes, and getting them confused is the classic bug:

| | `WorkflowContent` (stored/edited) | `LogicalPlan` (compiled/executed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where | `workflow.content` — a **JSON string** column | request body of `/api/compile`, `/api/execution/.../run` |
| Operators | `OperatorPredicate` — `operatorID`, `operatorType`, `operatorVersion`, `operatorProperties`, `inputPorts[]`, `outputPorts[]`, `customDisplayName`, … | flattened: properties spread at top level + `operatorID`/`operatorType` |
| Links | `{linkID, source:{operatorID,portID}, target:{operatorID,portID}}` — port IDs are `"input-0"`/`"output-0"` strings | `{fromOpId, fromPortId:{id,internal}, toOpId, toPortId:{id,internal}}` — port **ordinals** |
| Extras | `operatorPositions`, `commentBoxes`, `settings` | `opsToViewResult`, `opsToReuseResult` |

`agent-service` already implements both shapes and the conversion
(`buildLogicalPlan`, `WorkflowUtilService`, `WorkflowState`) — this is the code we lift
into the shared SDK rather than reimplement.

Operator catalogue comes from `GET /api/resources/operator-metadata` (**unauthenticated**):
every operator type with a JSON Schema for its properties plus port metadata. That is
what makes "add a `TableFilter` with these predicates" checkable *before* hitting the server.

### 1.4 Datasets are LakeFS repositories

`file-service` maps each dataset to a LakeFS repo `dataset-<did>`. The critical semantic
for tool design:

```
upload file  ─┐
delete file  ─┼─► uncommitted changes on branch `main`  ──► POST /{did}/version/create ──► immutable version (commit hash)
edit file    ─┘        (visible via GET /{did}/diff)
```

**Uploads are invisible to workflows until a version is created.** A naive MCP that only
exposes "upload" produces a dataset that silently doesn't work. So `dataset_create_version`
is a first-class tool, `dataset_uncommitted_changes` exists, and every upload tool result
tells the model what still has to happen.

Workflows reference dataset files by a path string, resolved by
[`FileResolver`](../common/workflow-core/src/main/scala/org/apache/texera/amber/core/storage/FileResolver.scala):

```
/ownerEmail/datasetName/versionName/relative/path.csv
   e.g. /me@uci.edu/covid/v1/data/cases.csv
```

`dataset_list_files` therefore returns **this exact string** for each file, ready to paste
into a `CSVFileScan.fileName` property. That single detail is what makes
"upload this CSV and build a workflow over it" a two-step conversation instead of a
scavenger hunt.

### 1.5 Execution

`POST /api/execution/{wid}/{cuid}/run` (`SyncExecutionResource`) runs a `LogicalPlan`
**synchronously** and returns per-operator results, row counts, compilation errors and
runtime errors — with server-side caps (`MAX_OPERATOR_RESULT_CHARS = 100_000`,
`MAX_OPERATOR_RESULT_CELL_CHARS = 20_000`). It also supports "execute to operator X"
(`targetOperatorIds` → upstream sub-DAG only).

This is *exactly* the shape an agent needs: one call, terminal result, errors included.
It requires a computing unit — on k8s each CU is a pod, hence the CU management tools.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Modules

```
texera/
├── packages/texera-sdk/          # NEW — shared TypeScript client + graph model
│   └── src/
│       ├── types/                # WorkflowContent, LogicalPlan, dataset, CU types
│       ├── api/                  # thin REST clients, one per backend area
│       └── graph/                # WorkflowState, auto-layout, metadata/schema validation
├── agent-service/                # refactored to import @texera/sdk
└── mcp-service/                  # NEW — the MCP server
    └── src/
        ├── config.ts             # env parsing + token introspection
        ├── server.ts             # McpServer wiring, tool registry
        ├── session.ts            # per-workflow edit sessions
        └── tools/                # one module per capability area
```

`@texera/sdk` is consumed via a `file:` dependency (no repo-root `package.json`, so the
frontend's yarn workspace and the sbt build are untouched). `mcp-service` bundles the SDK
into `dist/index.js` for `npx` distribution.

### 2.2 The edit session

Granular tools over server-side state, saved explicitly:

```
workflow_open(wid) ──► GET /api/workflow/{wid}
                       parse content JSON → WorkflowState
                       remember lastModifiedTime          (optimistic-concurrency token)
        │
        ├── workflow_add_operator / modify / delete
        ├── workflow_add_link / delete_link
        ├── workflow_auto_layout                          (dagre, so the graph is readable in the UI)
        └── workflow_validate ──► POST /api/compile       (schema propagation + per-operator errors)
        │
workflow_save() ──► GET /api/workflow/{wid} → compare lastModifiedTime
                    ├─ changed and !force → refuse, tell the model to re-open
                    └─ POST /api/workflow/persist (also snapshots a version)
```

Why not stateless whole-content read/write: an 80 KB `content` blob round-tripped through
the model on every edit is both expensive and a reliable way to produce structurally
invalid graphs. Why not live Yjs co-editing (yet): see §4.

Properties are validated against the operator's JSON Schema **client-side, before**
mutation, so the model gets `"predicates[0].attribute is required; expected {…}"`
instead of a 500 three steps later.

### 2.3 Tool surface

Verb-first, snake_case, area-prefixed. `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` annotations set
so clients can auto-approve reads.

**Session / discovery**

| Tool | Backing call |
| --- | --- |
| `texera_whoami` | decode JWT + `GET /api/config/pre-login`, `/api/config/gui` |

**Datasets**

| Tool | Backing call |
| --- | --- |
| `dataset_list` / `dataset_get` | `GET /api/dataset/list`, `/api/dataset/{did}` |
| `dataset_create` | `POST /api/dataset/create` |
| `dataset_update` (name, description, public, downloadable) | `POST /api/dataset/update/{name,description}`, `/{did}/update/{publicity,downloadable}` |
| `dataset_delete` ⚠ | `DELETE /api/dataset/{did}` |
| `dataset_list_versions` / `dataset_create_version` | `GET /{did}/version/list`, `POST /{did}/version/create` |
| `dataset_list_files` | `GET /{did}/version/{dvid}/rootFileNodes` → flattened + `FileResolver` paths |
| `dataset_upload_file` | `POST /{did}/upload` (single-shot) or `/multipart-upload` (large) |
| `dataset_delete_file` ⚠ | `DELETE /{did}/file` |
| `dataset_read_file` | `GET /presign-download` → fetch, text preview with caps |
| `dataset_uncommitted_changes` | `GET /{did}/diff` |
| `dataset_share` / `dataset_unshare` ⚠ | `PUT /api/access/dataset/grant/…`, `DELETE …/revoke/…` |

**Workflows**

| Tool | Backing call |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow_list` / `workflow_get` | `GET /api/workflow/list`, `/api/workflow/{wid}` |
| `workflow_create` / `workflow_duplicate` | `POST /api/workflow/create`, `/duplicate` |
| `workflow_delete` ⚠ | `POST /api/workflow/delete` |
| `workflow_update` (name, description, public) | `POST /api/workflow/update/{name,description}`, `/public/{wid}`, `/private/{wid}` |
| `workflow_list_versions` | `GET /api/version/{wid}` |
| `workflow_share` / `workflow_unshare` ⚠ | `PUT /api/access/workflow/grant/…`, `DELETE …/revoke/…` |
| **edit session** — `workflow_open`, `_describe`, `_add_operator`, `_modify_operator`, `_delete_operator`, `_add_link`, `_delete_link`, `_auto_layout`, `_validate`, `_save`, `_discard` | see §2.2 |
| `operator_list_types` / `operator_get_schema` | `GET /api/resources/operator-metadata` (cached) |

**Execution**

| Tool | Backing call |
| --- | --- |
| `computing_unit_list` / `_create` / `_terminate` ⚠ | `/api/computing-unit*` |
| `workflow_run` | `POST /api/execution/{wid}/{cuid}/run` |

### 2.4 Resources & prompts

- `texera://operator-metadata` — the operator catalogue (cached, big; a resource rather
  than a tool result so clients can pin it).
- `texera://workflow/{wid}` and `texera://dataset/{did}` — readable snapshots.
- Prompt `build_workflow_from_dataset` — the canonical
  upload → version → scan → transform → run loop, so a fresh chatbot does not have to
  rediscover the ordering constraints.

---

## 3. Safety

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Model deletes a dataset/workflow it misidentified | destructive tools require `confirm: true` **and** the exact name as a second argument; `destructiveHint` annotation set |
| Model overwrites edits made in the browser | optimistic concurrency on `lastModifiedTime`; `workflow_save` refuses on drift unless `force` |
| Token leakage into logs/transcripts | token never echoed; redaction in the error formatter; `texera_whoami` returns claims, never the raw token |
| Runaway result payloads | server caps (100 K chars/op) mirrored client-side; list tools paginate; file reads truncate with an explicit marker |
| Upload of a file that never becomes visible | every upload result states the pending-version requirement; `dataset_uncommitted_changes` surfaces it |
| Sharing data with the wrong person ⚠ | `*_share` requires explicit email + privilege, annotated destructive, never inferred |

---

## 4. Known limitation: live co-editing

The workspace UI edits through a Yjs document served at `/rtc` (`SharedModel`); the browser
tab is authoritative while a workflow is open. An MCP `workflow_save` is a REST
last-write-wins persist, so **edits made by the chatbot while the same workflow is open in a
browser tab can be clobbered by the tab** (and vice versa). v1 detects the common case via
`lastModifiedTime` and tells the user to close/reload the tab.

Making the chatbot a first-class co-editor — joining the Yjs room so operators appear on the
canvas live — is the natural v2 and is where this becomes genuinely impressive. It needs a
`y-websocket` client, awareness handling, and conflict semantics; deliberately out of scope
for the first cut.

---

## 5. Delivery plan

| Phase | Content | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `packages/texera-sdk` extracted from agent-service; agent-service imports it | done — agent-service's 132 tests stay green |
| 1 | Config, token introspection, error mapping, `texera_whoami`, stdio transport | done |
| 2 | Dataset tools | done |
| 3 | Workflow CRUD + operator catalogue + resources + prompt | done |
| 4 | Edit session + validate + save | done |
| 5 | Computing units + `workflow_run` | done |
| 6 | Sharing tools, README, `npx` bundle | done |
| 7 | Remote streamable-HTTP transport + Helm chart + gateway route | not started |
| 8 | Live Yjs co-editing (see §4) | not started |

362 tests across the three packages, all green. The MCP layer is tested through a real MCP client
over an in-memory transport against `src/testing/fake-texera.ts`, an HTTP-level stand-in — so tool
schemas, dispatch, handlers and error translation are exercised, not stubbed.

Verified against a live deployment (`texera.dknet-ai.org`): healthcheck, deployment-config
discovery, the operator catalogue with its real ~150-operator payload, compact-schema rendering,
and the authentication-failure path.

Per [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): Conventional Commits, and the Bun/TypeScript CI stack extended to
cover `packages/texera-sdk` and `mcp-service`.
