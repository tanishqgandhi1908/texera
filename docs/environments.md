# Environments

An **environment** is a Dockerfile a user owns and the image built from it. A computing
unit started from an environment runs that image instead of the deployment's default one,
so a workflow can use libraries, system packages and interpreters the default image
does not have.

## Why this replaces Python virtual environments

A Python virtual environment (`virtual_environments`) can only add pip packages to an
interpreter that already exists in the computing-unit image. Three common needs fall
outside that, and no amount of work within the mechanism reaches them:

| Need | Why a venv cannot | An environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A different Python version | `venv` is built from the image's own interpreter | `FROM` a different base, or install one |
| A system package (`hmmer`, `ffmpeg`, a driver) | a venv holds Python packages only | `apt-get install` as root at build time |
| A package that compiles from source | there is no build step, only `pip install <spec>` | any `RUN` you like |

A shell on a running pod does not close the gap either: that shell is the unprivileged
`texera` user, so `apt-get install` fails, and anything it did install would live in the
container's writable layer and vanish on the next restart. An image is built once, as
root, and is identical for every unit started from it.

Python virtual environments still exist and still work for per-UDF selection. Nothing is
migrated or removed.

## The flow

1. **Environments** in the sidebar → **New environment**.
2. Give it a name. The editor is pre-filled with the computing-unit image's own
   Dockerfile, so the starting point is what already exists rather than a blank file.
3. Saving starts a build. The card shows `BUILDING`; **Logs** shows the build's output and
   is readable at any point, during the build or long after it.
4. **Edit** and save to rebuild. **Rebuild** repeats a build without editing.
5. When creating a computing unit, pick the environment from the **Environment** dropdown.
   Only `READY` environments appear — one still building has no image, and a failed one
   never will.

## How a build runs

```
EnvironmentResource ──creates──▶ ConfigMap (Dockerfile + buildkitd.toml)
                    ──creates──▶ Job (BuildKit, rootless)
                                    │ pulls base image
                                    ▼
                                 registry ◀── pushes <registry>/texera-env/<eid>:<n>
                                    │
                                    ▼
                          kubelet pulls it for the CU pod
```

**BuildKit, not Kaniko.** Google archived Kaniko in June 2025; BuildKit is what replaced
it. Rootless specifically, because a build executes arbitrary user-supplied instructions
and a privileged builder would make the cluster's isolation depend on the Dockerfile being
well behaved. Rootless costs an unconfined seccomp/AppArmor profile and nothing else.

**One registry address for two different resolvers.** The BuildKit job pushing an image is
a pod and resolves cluster DNS; the kubelet pulling it is not and does not. A ClusterIP is
the one address both can reach, so the registry Service pins one
(`environmentRegistry.clusterIP`) rather than being assigned one — an image reference
embeds the address, so it has to survive a reinstall of the chart.

**The tag carries a build number.** A rebuild publishes `:<n+1>` rather than overwriting
`:<n>`, so a computing unit already running an earlier build is unaffected by a rebuild.

**Status is reconciled on read.** A build finishes on the cluster, not in the service, so
a row learns its outcome when someone lists or opens it. That keeps the feature free of
background threads and leader election; the UI polls while a build is in flight anyway.

## Setup

The base image has to be in the registry before any environment can build, because the
BuildKit job is a pod and cannot see images that exist only in the node's local daemon:

```bash
bin/k8s/push-base-image.sh [minikube-profile] [source-image]
```

Run it again whenever the engine image is rebuilt. Environments built before that keep
running the older base until they are rebuilt themselves.

## Configuration

| Value | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `environments.enabled` | `true` | Turns the feature and its API off entirely |
| `environments.builderImage` | `moby/buildkit:v0.18.2-rootless` | What runs the build |
| `environments.buildNamespace` | the computing-unit pool namespace | Where build jobs run |
| `environments.buildTimeoutSeconds` | `3600` | A build past this is killed |
| `environments.baseImage` | `<registry>/texera/computing-unit-master:dev` | Pre-filled `FROM`, and what user Dockerfiles are expected to build on |
| `environmentRegistry.clusterIP` | `10.96.0.99` | Pinned; must be inside the Service CIDR the container runtime treats as insecure |
| `environmentRegistry.persistence.enabled` | `false` | Off means built images are lost if the registry pod restarts |

## Known limits of this proof of concept

- **The registry is plain HTTP with no authentication.** It works only because container
  runtimes are configured to treat the Service CIDR as insecure. A real deployment
  terminates TLS and gives the pull a credential.
- **Nothing constrains what a Dockerfile may do.** A build runs arbitrary instructions with
  network access, and an image that omits `USER texera` runs as **root** in the computing-unit
  pod, because the pod spec sets no `securityContext` of its own. Before this is exposed to
  users who are not administrators, the pod spec should pin `runAsUser`/`runAsNonRoot` so
  the image cannot decide.
- **No quota on images or builds.** Nothing limits how many environments a user creates, how
  large an image may be, or how long the registry keeps old build tags.
- **The Dockerfile editor is a textarea**, not a syntax-highlighting editor.
- **Deleting an environment leaves its images in the registry.** The rows and build jobs go;
  the pushed layers stay.
