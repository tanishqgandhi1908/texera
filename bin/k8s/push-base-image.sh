# them is a pod: it cannot see images that exist only in the node's local daemon,
# so the base has to be in a registry it can pull from.
#
# Run once after installing the chart, and again whenever the engine image is
# rebuilt -- environments built before that keep running the older base until
# they are rebuilt themselves.
