"""
texera-mounter: a per-node privileged service that performs GeeseFS FUSE mounts on behalf
of (unprivileged) computing-unit pods.

A CU pod POSTs /mount with {cuid, repositoryName, commitHash, jwt, fileServiceBase}. The
mounter runs GeeseFS against file-service's JWT-authenticated S3 proxy (passing the pod's
JWT as the S3 access key) and mounts read-only under MOUNT_ROOT/<cuid>/<repo>/<commit>.
That host directory is bind-mounted (mountPropagation: Bidirectional) into the mounter and
propagates back into the CU pod (mountPropagation: HostToContainer), so the CU pod sees
the mount without any privilege of its own.

The mounter holds no LakeFS credentials; authorization stays entirely in file-service.
A background watcher unmounts a CU's directories as soon as its pod is deleted.
